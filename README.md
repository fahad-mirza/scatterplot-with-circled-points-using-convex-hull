# Scatterplot with circled groups using a Convex Hull

Using Asjad Naqvi's Delaunay Package (https://github.com/asjadnaqvi/stata-delaunay-voronoi), I generate a scatterplot that encircles all the points by group in Stata. 

The example makes use of default Stata dataset and creates a rubber band like plot around group points.
