# scatterplot-with-circled-points-using-convex-hull
Using Asjad Naqvi's Delaunay Package, I generate a scatterplot that encircles all the points on a scatterplot by group. The example makes use of default dataset and creates a rubber band like plot around group points. The method is not clean and neat but does the trick for now.
